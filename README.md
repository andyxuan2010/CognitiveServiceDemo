# CognitiveSearchDemo
## requirement
Our goal is to set up an Azure Cognitive Services account and deploy a language model into it. The
environment needs to be created in a reproducible manner, in our case scripted in Terraform.
Please complete the following draft so that a secure Azure Cognitive Services account gets created
and the “gpt-35-turbo” model gets deployed. Make sure that the API is only accessible via private
Endpoint.
